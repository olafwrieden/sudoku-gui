# Sudoku GUI Java Game
As part of my Computer Science Degree, one of my assignments was to design and build a software product - a game. 

### The Design Brief
This project contains two stages:
1. In [Stage 1](https://github.com/olafwrieden/sudoku-cui/ "Stage 1 Code"), you will need to develop a Command-line User Interface (CUI) version of the
product. You will need to use text files to store input and output data from the program.
2. In Stage 2 **(this repo)**, you will upgrade the product to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version. Meanwhile, you will include a Database component to the product, implement design patterns and include necessary unit tests.

* Must be developed using Java in the NetBeans IDE.
* Be bug free and feature robust error handling.
* Should be easy to build (no complex build configurations).
* Needs to use 
[Apache Derby](https://db.apache.org/derby/ "Apache Derby") (JavaDB) as the DBMS for the project.
* Must contain basic unit tests for a few important functionalities of the program.
