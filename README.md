# Sudoku GUI Java Game
As part of my Computer Science Degree, one of my assignments was to design and build a software product - a game. 

### The Design Brief
This project contains two stages:
1. In [Stage 1](https://github.com/olafwrieden/sudoku-cui/ "Stage 1 Code"), you will need to develop a Command-line User Interface (CUI) version of the
product. You will need to use text files to store input and output data from the program.
2. In Stage 2 **(this repo)**, you will upgrade the product to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version. Meanwhile, you will include a Database component to the product, implement design patterns and include necessary unit tests.

* Must be developed using Java in the NetBeans IDE.
* Be bug-free and feature robust error handling.
* Should be easy to build (no complex build configurations).
* Needs to use 
[Apache Derby](https://db.apache.org/derby/ "Apache Derby") (JavaDB) as the DBMS for the project.
* Must contain basic unit tests for a few important functionalities of the program.

## Game Overview

#### Home Screen
The *Home Screen* is shown after a user has logged in. From here, various application functions can be called and a list of high scores seen.

#### Sudoku Game
Inside the *Sudoku Game*, players are presented with a grid of chosen difficulty. Cell highlighting allows players to visually see all cells related to the selected one, as per Sudoku rules. Meanwhile, a timer keeps track of the game duration.
**NOTE:** At any point in the game, you may exit. But unlike the [CUI Version from Stage 1](https://github.com/olafwrieden/sudoku-cui/ "Stage 1 Code"), your game will **not** be saved!

#### Need a Hint?
Sometimes players get stuck and need a hint. Based on the difficulty of the grid, a certain number of hints are available throughout the game to fill in a random cell that does not yet contain a digit. Don't run out!

#### Sudoku Rules
Unsure of how to play? From the home screen, or at any time during a game, players may view the *Sudoku Rules*. Read quickly because the timer isn't stopping for you!

#### Sudoku Solved?
When a Sudoku puzzle is filled (provided there are no errors - these are caught throughout the game), players are presented with game statistics and awarded points depending on their grid's difficulty.

## User Access Controls

#### Sign Up or Log In
Sudoku is great when competing with friends, this game enables players to create an account and sign in so that every puzzle completed rewards points. This is where the database component comes in.

Sign Up | Log In

#### Database Connection Error
If you have incorrectly configured the Apache Derby client required for this project, an error may be thrown preventing the game from starting. Only one instance of the Sudoku Game is currently supported.
